    "# Exercise 2: Visualization of Results\n",
    "In this exercise you will visualize and explore the results of the previous exercise in a simple manner, using scatterplots. This will be a relatively open-ended task; you will choose three data sets and explore them with the new technique you built for yourself. These could be data sets you already used in previous assignments, or you could download some new data. The only restrictions are that (a) the data sets must be multidimensional (i.e., more than 4 features), (b)\n",
    "they must have labels, and (c) they must have at least 1000 data points.\n",

    "Be careful, however, with the size of the data set you choose. Matlab or Python can get quite slow with too much data, and the scatterplots will also be very crowded, so go for smaller data sets this time."
